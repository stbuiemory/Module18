<h1 align="center">Social Network API</h1>

```sh

Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts,
react to friends‚Äô thoughts, and create a friend list. 

You‚Äôll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to
using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date
library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

## User Story

- AS A social media startup
- I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
- SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API:

- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
  THEN my server is started, and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
  THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
  THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.

- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
  THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends
  to a user‚Äôs friend list.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Testing

```sh
Unfortunately, this app is still a work in progress.  I had a lot of problems with the app itself.
Please check back at a later time.
